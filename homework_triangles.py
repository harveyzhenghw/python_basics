# Triangles in Maths — Clearer Task

# Write a program that:

# Reads three side lengths a, b, c.

# Checks if a valid triangle can be built
# – all sides must be positive, and the longest < sum of the other two.
# – If not valid, print a message and stop.

# Prints:

# the shortest and longest side,

# the side-length type: equilateral (all equal), isosceles (two equal), or scalene (all different),

# the perimeter,

# the angle type using the Pythagorean relation on the longest side:
# right (c² = a²+b²), obtuse (c² > a²+b²), acute (c² < a²+b²).
# If it’s equilateral, also say equiangular (all angles 60°).
